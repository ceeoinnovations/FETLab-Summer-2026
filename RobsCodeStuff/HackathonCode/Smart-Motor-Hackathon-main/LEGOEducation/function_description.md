# Other Functions

## begin_batch(self)
Start batching commands into a single BLE packet. When batch mode is active, motor commands are queued instead of being sent immediately. Call `end_batch()` to send all queued commands in a single packet. This ensures they all start nearly simultaneously. Note: If a previous batch was never ended, it is automatically discarded and a warning is logged.

### Simple Example:
```python
# Double Motor: configure Double Motor and start both motors together
doublemotor.begin_batch()
doublemotor.motor_run(motor=le.MOTOR_LEFT, speed=50)
doublemotor.motor_run(motor=le.MOTOR_RIGHT, speed=10)
doublemotor.end_batch() # start together
```

## end_batch(self, blocking=True)
Sends all batched commands in a single packet. To use effectively, use `begin_batch()` to create a queue of motor commands and call `end_batch()` to start all queued commands nearly simultaneously.

### Parameters:
- `blocking`: Wait for the command(s) to be completed before continuing.

### Simple Example:
```python
# Double Motor: configure Double Motor and start both motors together
doublemotor.begin_batch()
doublemotor.motor_run(motor=le.MOTOR_LEFT, speed=50)
doublemotor.motor_run(motor=le.MOTOR_RIGHT, speed=10)
doublemotor.end_batch() # start together
```

## batch(self, blocking=True)
Context manager for batch mode operations. This block automatically calls `begin_batch()` on entry and `end_batch()` on exit. If an error occurs inside the block, it ensures batch mode is properly closed.

### Parameters:
- `blocking`: Wait for the command(s) to be completed before continuing.

### Simple Example:
```python
# Double Motor: configure Double Motor and start both motors together
with doublemotor.batch():

# Filter for Controllers by Connection Card of color red
controller = le.Controller()
sensorlist = controller.search(card_color=le.LEGO_COLOR_RED)
# Print each Controller found
if (sensorlist):
    for i in range(len(sensorlist)):
        print(sensorlist[i])
```

## connect(self, device=None, *, device_name=None, device_mac=None, card_color=None, card_serial=None, device_notification_delay = DEFAULT_DEVICE_NOTIFICATION_DELAY)
Connect to hardware. This function will use Bluetooth to scan and connect to the first hardware found based on any filters specified.

### Parameters:
- `device`: A device entry returned from `search()`. When `None` (default), a scan is performed automatically.
- `device_name`: Filter for hardware by name contents.
- `device_mac`: Filter for hardware by MAC address contents.
- `card_color`: Filter for hardware by a Connection Card of a specific color using a LEGO Color constant.
- `card_serial`: Filter for hardware by a Connection Card of a specific serial number. Use a string (e.g., "0049") for serials with leading zeros.
- `device_notification_delay`: Duration in milliseconds between automatic device notifications. When this value is greater than 0, the command waits for the first notification before returning. Must be 0 or between 15 and 1000.

### Simple Example:
```python
# Single Motor: Scan and connect to the first Single Motor found.
singlemotor = le.SingleMotor()
singlemotor.connect()

# Double Motor: Scan and connect to the first Double Motor found.
doublemotor = le.DoubleMotor()
doublemotor.connect()
```

### More Examples:
```python
# Controller: Connect to a Controller indicated by the specified Connection Card.
controller = le.Controller()
controller.connect(card_color=le.LEGO_COLOR_RED, card_serial="1234")
```

## disconnect(self)
Disconnect from the hardware. This resets the hardware back to Bluetooth broadcast mode.

### Simple Example:
```python
# Single Motor: Disconnect from the Single Motor.
singlemotor.disconnect()
```

## set_notification_callback(self, callback: Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], Any])
Register a callback function to handle hardware notifications. This method sets a callback function that will be invoked whenever the hardware sends sensor updates.

### Parameters:

### Simple Example:
```python
# Single Motor: set a notification callback
singlemotor.set_notification_callback(notification_callback)
```

### More Examples:
```python
# Define a function for handling Single Motor notifications
def notification_callback(data):
    parsed_items = le.device_notification_parser(data)
    for parsed_item in parsed_items: 
        if isinstance(parsed_item, le.MotorNotification):
            print(f"Single Motor position: {parsed_item.position}")
# Set Single Motor notification callback
singlemotor.set_notification_callback(notification_callback)
```

## info(self)

### Simple Example:
```python
# Single Motor: Get technical information about the Single Motor
info = singlemotor.info()

### More Examples:
```python
# Iterate through and print all technical information about the the Color Sensor
for key, value in vars(colorsensor.info()).items():
    if (type(value) is int):
        print(key, value)
```

## device_uuid(self)
Get the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) of the hardware. The UUID is linked to the hardware and does not change even if the device is reset or updated.

### Simple Example:
```python
# Single Motor: Print the UUID of a Single Motor.
response = singlemotor.device_uuid()
print(response.uuid.hex()) # print byte array as hex
```

## program_flow_notification(self, action: int, *, blocking: bool = True)
Tell the hardware that a program has started or stopped. This resets many device settings depending on the chosen action.

### Parameters:
- `action`: Specify the type of program action using a Program Action constant.
- `blocking`: Wait for the command to be completed before continuing.

### Simple example:
```python
# Single Motor: Mark the program as started.
singlemotor.program_flow_notification(le.PROGRAM_ACTION_START)
```

### More examples:
```python
# Mark the Single Motor program as stopped.
singlemotor.program_flow_notification(le.PROGRAM_ACTION_STOP)
```

## device_notification_request(self, delay_ms: int, *, blocking: bool = True)
Set how often the hardware sends automatic notifications. The contents of the notification vary based on the type of hardware, and can include button presses, sensor values and other state changes reported by the hardware.

### Parameters:
- `delay_ms`: Duration in milliseconds between notifications. Must be 0 (to turn off notifications) or between 15 and 1000.
- `blocking`: Wait for the command to be completed before continuing.

### Simple Example:
```python
# Single Motor: Set duration between notifications to 50 milliseconds.
singlemotor.device_notification_request(50)
```

### More Examples:
```python
# Turn off the automatic notifications on the Single Motor
singlemotor.device_notification_request(0)
```

## light_color(self, color: int, *, pattern: int = 0, intensity: int = 100, blocking: bool = True)
Set the button light color and blink pattern on the hardware.

### Parameters:
- `color`: Set the light color using a LEGO Color constant.
- `pattern`: Set the light behavior using a Light Pattern (Button on Hardware) constant.

# Set the light color on the Single Motor to blue at 50% intensity
singlemotor.light_color(le.LEGO_COLOR_BLUE, intensity=50)
    
# Set the light color on the Single Motor to green with a "breathe" blink pattern and 75% intensity
singlemotor.light_color(le.LEGO_COLOR_GREEN, pattern=le.LIGHT_PATTERN_BREATHE, intensity=75)
```

## beep(self, *, pattern: int = SOUND_PATTERN_BEEP_SINGLE, frequency: int = 440, count: int = 1, blocking: bool = True)
Play a beep sound pattern on the hardware.

### Parameters:

time.sleep(3)
colorsensor.stop_beep() # stop beep sounds after three seconds

## device_notification_parser(notification_obj)
This function processes a notification object to extract hardware notifications. Each notification is deserialized and added to a list, which is returned by the function.

### Parameters:

```python
# In a notification handler, parse the notification object to get a list of hardware notifications.
parsed_items = le.device_notification_parser(data)

```python
# Parse the data (and iterate through list) in a notification callback
def notification_callback(data):
    parsed_items = le.device_notification_parser(data)
    for parsed_item in parsed_items: 
        if isinstance(parsed_item, le.MotorNotification):
            print(f"Single Motor position: {parsed_item.position}")
# Set Single Motor notification callback
singlemotor.set_notification_callback(notification_callback)
```
